# Pokedex

This is POC Project to try out **Sapient Slingshot** - an AI tool and **Github Pages** deployment.

## Assignment
Follow any Generative AI tools of your choice (e.g. Slingshot, AI Code Companion, Chat GPT, etc), our recommendation is Slingshot. By using the Gen AI tool you need to add/update the code into the above selected code base.All these steps mentioned below, you need to follow these using Gen AI tools and the prompt engineering best practices you learned.

- Add Type script related configurations (tslint, build, dev commands etc)
- Convert the JS code into the Typescript
- Add Storybook configurations
- Add Storybook for all the components
- Add React Testing Library configurations
- Write the test cases using RTL

## Evalution Result
|Criteria|	Score|	Explanation|
|:--------|:-----------:|:-------------|
|Code Quality|8|The code is well organized with clear ESLint rules promoting quality. However, more documentation or project overview could enhance the understanding of overall quality practices.|
|Typescript|9|The presence of TypeScript configurations indicates a robust integration but insights into full implementation are limited without access to additional TypeScript type definitions.|
|React Testing Library|6|Lack of direct evidence of RTL integration in the provided snippet reduces the overall evaluation score concerning its use and configuration.|
|Storybook|9|Tailored Storybook configurations with various addons suggest a capable setup. Ensuring coverage for all components could enhance evaluation.|
|Jest|7|Jest is referenced within the configuration, but information on test coverage or specific configurations is sparse, necessitating more insight for comprehensive evaluation.|
